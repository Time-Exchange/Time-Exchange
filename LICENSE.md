This call is for all producers and consumers.

While manufacturers aim to produce the highest quality products, consumers want to prefer the highest quality product or service. After all, this is what happens.

Again;

There has always been an intermediate layer between producers and consumers in the world.

A unit of product or service produced is delivered to the consumer in less than one unit.

This is due to the presence of interlayers that cause a unit of product or service to be reduced or consumed during transportation.

However, these intermediate layers do not provide a real benefit in production and do not approach consumption.

Consumers sometimes, and even most of the time, start to consume the products or services they do not want as if they were their own demand. In fact, these are strategic marketing techniques of middleware that encourage consumption.

In fact, we are in a manipulative system where we go one step further and consume as if we were demanding it ourselves.

Awareness;

Why do we give some of our own time to someone else and for nothing?

Aim;

It is precisely equalizing what is produced and what is consumed.

The basic unit of production is time. And the producer is willing to consume some of the time he produces. The consumer desires this produced time.

Definition;

It is a time exchange system that aims to equate all kinds of products/services produced by the producer in a unit of time to the consumer with the same unit of time.

Mechanism;

Everyone who contributes to production, including the production, development and improvement of this formation system, should be rewarded for the time they spend.
